Getting and Cleaning Data Week 4 Assignment for Coursera

(If the tidy data tidy.txt does not show up in the upload, it is not because it wasn't tried several times.  It seems to try to operate yet does not show that it was completed after attempting the upload.  Coursera technical assistance was consulted.  It is in the repository with other required files, however, and you can view it there.)


The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis

Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

This Repository contains:

Run_analysis.R, and R script that 
	- merges the test and training data sets into one dataset with descriptive activity names and labeled with descriptive variable names
	- extracts mean and standard deviation measurements
	- writes a tidy data set
